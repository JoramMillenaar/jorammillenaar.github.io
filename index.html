                        practices, and tools to boost productivity. Advocated for and implemented good coding practices
                        including Test-Driven Development (TDD), iterative development, and effective use of AI tools.
                        This led to an impressive 95% test coverage, significantly reducing post-launch issues and
                        stabilizing the project despite its complexity.

                    We saw him growing almost every day. He has been off great value, always contributing to technical
                    ánd functional discussions. He was one of the first in our team to start working with co-pilot,
                    pioneering for us and getting the other team-members up to speed after he investigated it
                    thoroughly. He has proactively build features that turned out to be of great value for our company,
