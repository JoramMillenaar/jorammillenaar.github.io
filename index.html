                        practices, and tools to boost productivity. Advocated for and implemented good coding practices
                        including Test-Driven Development (TDD), iterative development, and effective use of AI tools.
                        This led to an impressive 95% test coverage, significantly reducing post-launch issues and
                        stabilizing the project despite its complexity.

                    While at Therapieland, Joram was a valuable and indispensable member of our development team. He was
                    integral to the successful implementation and deployment of our new patient treatment and management
                    platform. His work on critical systems and tools ensured that our existing users could be migrated
                    effortlessly (from our legacy platform) with no disruption in the delivery of services. Through his
                    drive and initiative, Joram built a remarkable data visualisation tool, that gave us vital insights
                    into our current user-base and the interdependencies between various domain entities, allowing us to
                    make informed decisions about our migration path going forward, and allowed us to identify any
                    potential risks involved.

                <p class="modal-text">
                    Joram's ability to acquire new skills, and effectively apply them to his work, is outstanding. He is
                    intelligent, naturally curious, hard-working, and constantly striving to improve himself as a
                    developer: traits that were highly valued and appreciated within our team during our demanding
                    development roadmap. He has an infectious personality and a sharp wit, and always added his positive
                    energy to the team.

                    Joram has worked in the Product Development Team that I was PO of for more than 3 years. When he
                    started, he was a junior developer, and we immediately saw how dedicated and eager to learn he was.
                    We saw him growing almost every day. He has been off great value, always contributing to technical
                    ánd functional discussions. He was one of the first in our team to start working with co-pilot,
                    pioneering for us and getting the other team-members up to speed after he investigated it
                    thoroughly. He has proactively build features that turned out to be of great value for our company,
                    and has always shown great dedication and commitment. And besides his great development-skills, he
                    is also a great guy and a pleasure to work with!

                    After three awesome years working with Joram, I just want to give a big shout-out to him. It's been
                    a blast on both the professional and personal fronts. He is the go-to guy for bouncing around ideas
                    – he's always up for a chat and has this knack for pushing us towards the best solutions.

                <p class="modal-text">
                    One of the cool things about him is his superpower of turning messy, vague ideas into something
                    concrete and organized.

                <p class="modal-text">
                    Hope our paths cross again down the road. Can't wait for more adventures with Joram in the future!
